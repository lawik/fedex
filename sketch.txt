How do I want to work with these?

host = Host.local("u7d.io")

actor = Actor.person(host, "lawik")

target_actor = Actor.from_id("@lawik@fosstodon.org")

note =
    Note.new(actor, "This is my note", to: [Addressing.public(), Addressing.followers_of(actor)])

activity = Activity.create(actor, note, to: [Addressing.public(), Addressing.followers_of(actor)])
